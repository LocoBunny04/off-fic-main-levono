            <h2 id ="pn"><h3>: I finally reached my school trying to catch my breath, I told myself 'Breathe in...breathe out...*sigh* Hwaiting!' I walked down the hallway to my locker. Minding my own business, I opened my locker to get my books when all the sudden the hallway became dead quiet. I turned around and came face to face with my bully<a id ="bn">, and her annoying clique.</p>
                <!--<h2 id ="bn">-->[bully]: 'Hey brat! Did you do my project from last week?' She said in her annoying high-pitch voice.</p>

                <!--<h2 id ="bn">--><h3>[bully]:'씨발 (Ssi-Bal) dumbass, beat her until she learns her damn lesson!' She yells to her clique.
                The girls beat me up until the principal was seen coming towards the chaos. <!--<a id="bn">-->[bully] told them to stop and force me to stand.</p>
