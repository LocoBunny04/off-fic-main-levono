            <h2 id ="pn"><h2>'I've got no other choice, I'll call Felix and hope he won't get mad at me...'[On the phone]: 'Felix baby..?'<p>
                <h2>Felix: *breathing heavily* 'Yes baby?...Do you need someone to pick you up? ... I'll pick you up.<p>
                <h2 id ="pn">: 'Yes, b-but I got a f-favor to ask...'<p>
                <h2> Felix: 'Why are you stuttering, tell me what's wrong baby.'<p>
                <h2 id="pn">: 'P-principal told me that I have to call my guardian, but my parents are overseas...and I-I was wondering i-if y-you would come instead......?'<p>
                    <h2>Felix: 'Of course baby, but what is the problem? Did you get hurt?...Did someone bully you...?'<p>
                    <h2 id="pn">: 'I-I, she di-...' I burst into tears before I could finish my explanation.<p>
                        <h2>Felix: 'Shhh baby, you are okay...okay? I am coming.' He ended the call.<p>
                <h2>"Principal: 'Where is your guardian? It has been 20 minutes.<p>
                    <h2 id="pn">: 'H-he's coming...'I said as I was rubbing my sore leg in hopes to soothe with the pain.<p>
                        <h2 id="bn">: 'Her parents are soooo slow,'. My bully said annoyed...'they are probably like 50 years old.'<p>
                            <h2>Bully's Mom: 'Shh, sweetie wait a little longer.'
                <h2 id="bn">: 'Ughh-'<p>
                    <h2>[Knock, Knock, Knock]...<h2>
                        <h2>Felix: 'Sorry for the wait.' He said while entering and closing the door behind him.<p>
                            <h2>Principal: 'A-aren't you Lee Felix...?' The principal asked looking at the young guy, a little surprised.....your group won the award? My bully stared at Felix the whole time...<p>
                                <h2>Felix: 'Yes sir.' He answered.<p>
                                    <h2>Principal: 'W-what are you doing here...?'</p>
                <h2 id="bn">: 'Because I called him duhh, babyyyy-' my bully whined at Felix.'...Felix stared at my bully in disgust.<p>
                    <h2>Felix: 'I'm here for my baby, <p id= "pn"><h2>[y/n]. My bully's eyes widen<p>
                        <h2 id="pn">: 'Baby,' I said to him grabbing his attention\n\nFelix: 'Hey baby, what's wrong?' He said as he bent down to my level, caressing my cheeks with his hand, the other caressing my hands. Looking into my puffy, yet shiny eyes.'<p>
                <h2 id="pn">I pointed at my legs, Felix pressed it a little and I whimper.<p>
                    <h2>Felix: 'I am sorry, does it hurt a lot?' He said worriedly. I nodded as a tear rolled down, the principal cleared his throat.<p>
                        <h2> Principal: 'L-let's start, [y/n] was seen to have been accused of slapping and pushing [bully], but I only saw [y/n] push [bully].<p>
                            <h2>Bully's Mom: 'I say we should suspend [y/n] for doing such a thing to my child!' She blurted out.<p>
                <h2 id="bn"> My bully smirked,'I don't know why you would date such a person.<p>
                    <h2 id="pn">: My bully said in disgust, while looking at me up and down. Felix heard that and was going to do something about it, but I pulled on his sleeve. 'Lixie' I said softly, as I looked at him. He calmed down a little, he kneeled with one knee next to me, eyeing [bully].<p>
                <h2>Felix asked 'Do you have any proof? Just because you said it happened...doesn't mean it's true. We can ask other students OR view the security cameras.'<h2>Then [bully]'s expression changed.<h2 id= "bully"><h2>'s mind: 'Damn it...What if I get suspended?'<p>
                    <h2>Felix: 'Let's view the security footage then. While the principal was looking for the footage Felix lifted [y/n] gently and sat himself in the chair previously occupied by his baby. He then placed [y/n] on his lap facing towards him. [y/n] snuggled into his neck, chin resting on Felix's shoulder, and arms wrapped around him. With [y/n] eyes closed, Felix began to stroke "[y/n]'s back gently to relax his baby.<p>
                <h2>"Meanwhile, [bully] watched the couple with a zealous expression. The principal finally found the footage during the passing periods in the hallway, where the incident occurred. Everyone in the room except [y/n] watched. After reviewing the footage, They all were shocked as [bully] smiled awkwardly, 'hehehe...look, I can explain.<p>
                    <h2>Felix: 'THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPLAIN, LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE!' Felix yelled in anger.
                <h2>Principal: '[bully]! You are suspended'<h2>Bully's Mom: 'I am so disappointed! Wait until we get home!'<p>
