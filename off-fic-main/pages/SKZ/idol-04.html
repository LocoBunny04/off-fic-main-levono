            <h2>Part IV of IV</h2>
                <h2 id="pn"> woke up due to all the screaming, 'Hmm...? What's wrong...? Baby...? I said while hugging Felix.<p>
                    <h2>Felix: 'Shh, it's okay...just continue to rest.'<p>
                        <h2>He said lifting me by my butt as support as he walked out of the office and strode through the hallways. Students' eyes follow his every move with their mouths hanging open. However, Felix didn't care he was solely focused on getting me home. He placed me in the back, giving me more room to sleep. He then got into the driver's seat and drove home....[Time Skips]....He parks the car in front of our house, then came and opened the car door like a gentleman.<p>
                    <h2>However, I was asleep. He gently picks me up and my arms automatically wrap around his neck, as my legs wrap around his waist. Felix supported me and walked to the front door.<p>
                <h2>"He puts his keys and my bag on the ground...then carries me up to the bathroom. He then says 'Hey baby...wake up hun...we're home let's take a bath, hm?' Yawning, I woke up while he helps me undress. <p>
                    <h2>He then prepares the bath, he got in and told me to come in. Limping towards the bathtub, I got in and laid on his chest. He then began to scrub my body with soap.'<p>
                <h2>"He then move to my legs. While scrubbing, Felix accidentally scrubbed my injured leg a little too hard, causing me to whimper in pain into his chest.<p>
                    <h2>Felix: 'I am sorry hun, does it still hurt?'<p>
                        <h2 id="pn">: I nod my head.....[10 minutes later].....Felix helped me get out, he placed me on the corner of the bathtub while he dried me and him.<p>
                            <h2>Felix: 'Wait here...' He then wraps me in a towel.<p>
                <h2>He came back with clothes. He dressed himself then helped me with my underwear and t-shirt. He got the first aid kit and started applying ointment onto my sore leg, then he carried me to bed.<p>
                    <h2>Placing me on the bed, Felix lays down next to me. I scooted closer to him putting my head on his chest listening to his heartbeat.<p>
                <h2>After a while Felix asked me, 'Did she always bully you...? Did she always...h-hurt you?<p>
                    <h2 id="pn">:I was silent...then I whispered, 'y-yes she d-did'. I heard sobs. Looking up from Felix's chest, the sight I never wanted to see...Felix crying.<p>
                        <h2>Felix: 'I-I'm so sorry, I didn't protect you when you needed me...I-I'm such a bad boyfriend...' Felix said while he was a sobbing mess, his nose pink, and tears covering his beautiful freckles.<p>
                            <h2> I caress his cheeks, wiping his tears away from his freckles. I then laid my forehead on his, our nose touching. 'Don't speak nonsense you're the only sunshine I could've ask for.' I then smashed my lips onto his, he responded to my kiss.<p>
                <h2 id="pn"><h2>As we both parted, we lovingly look into each other's eyes. We both smiled, Felix, with his big, goofy, lovestruck, lopsided grin. I then laid my head on his chest, closed my eyes and said,<p>
                    <h2 id="pn">: 'I love you baby...and I will never stop.<p>
                    <h2>Felix responded with, 'I love you too, and will for the rest of my life.' We then fell asleep in each other's embrace.<p>
