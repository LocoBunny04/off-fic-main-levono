  <p id ="rm">Y/N P.O.V.</p><p>One day my parents invited me and my husband for dinner. Namjoon and I were getting ready to head over.</p><h2>I wore a beautiful and seductive dress.</h2>
  <p>Namjoon got ready and found you wearing a beautiful and sexy dress.</p><h2>RM: "Umm...Y/N"</h2><h2>Y/N: "Wae? Joon, your ready...that is fast! I'll be ready in five minutes."</h2>
  <h2>RM: "Isn't your dress a bit too reaveling?</h2><h2>Y/N: "So what?"</h2><h2>RM: "Baby we are not going to a party. We are going to a family dinner."</h2><h2>Y/N: "So what?"</h2>
  <h2>RM: *Gulps* "Baby why don't you change into another - less reaveling dress?"</h2><h2>Y/N: "No Joon, if you don't like my dress, don't look at me. Problem solve. End of Discussion. Come on lets go."</h2>
  <p>Arrving to the home, the family dinner began. My dad was speaking to Namjoon. As he continue to talk to Namjoon, I noticed that Joon was mot listening to a single thing my dad was saying his whole attention was on me.</p>
  <h2>Y/N: "Daddy can you pass me the salt?"</h2><p>Both Namjoon and my dad reached for the salt and Namjoon awkwardly looked towards my dad while I choked/coughed hysterically.</p>
  <h2>Y/N:"Umm...I'll just grab it myself." 'What is wrong with my Joon? Why is he embaressing me infront of everyone?'</h2><p>I finished eating and headed towards the kitchen. Namjoon followed soon after.</p>
  <p>I started washing the dishes when I felt a familiar pair of arms wrapping my waist. It was Namjoon, he tighten his grip when I tried turning around, and began kissing my neck.</p>
  <h2>Y/N: "So Joon, what happend to you? You were quite distrubed earlier." He turned me around and looked adoringly into my eyes while I placed my hands on his forehead.</h2>
  <h2>Y/N: "What? Do you have a temperature or something?...You seem fine.</h2><p>Namjoon creased his eyebrows and lifted me up and placed me on the kitchen counter.</p><h2>Y/N: "Hey...what are you doing...?"</h2>
  <p>He smirked and smashed his lips onto mine and began to kiss me roughly. With a smile, I kissed him back. Too immersed into the kiss, we did not hear the approaching footsteps.</p><p> I subsequently open my eyes and came face to face with
      my dad's, I immediately pushed Namjoon away and hopped off the counter.</p><p>Embaressed, Namjoon quickly left towards the living room and I went back to doing the dishes. He sat there, talking with my dad. I knew he was needy, but decided to tease him. </p>
  <p>RM POV</p><p>After a while Y/N's dad got a call and excused himself. Not long after, Y/N came into the dinning room to collect the other dishes.
      I saw an opportunity and dragged Y/N upstairs to Y/N's childhood room.</p><p>Y/N POV</p><h2>Y/N: "Joon? What are you doing?</h2>
      <h2>RM: "Baby... I'm needy..."</h2><h2>Y/N: "What? Now? No..no.no"</h2><p>Namjoon held me closer to him and began to suck on my sensitive spot below my ears. After no reaction, he increased the pressure, causing me to moan.</p>
      <h2>Y/N: *m*an* "Joon... what are you doing?...My dad, is just downstairs."</h2><h2>RM: "I want to do it..."</h2><h2>Y/N: "Whaat? *pushes him away* now... no.no.no"</h2><h2>Rm: "Just help me...Y/N. *grabs me and said* This is why I 
          told you not to wear this dress. Also, why did you call me daddy? Are you trying to provoke me? I want to do it now."</h2><h2>Y/N: "I didn't call you daddy...I called my dad...but you know, you just embarrassed me infront of my DAD!</h2>
      </h2><h2>Y/N: "Look Namjoon, we'll do it when we reach ho...."</h2><p>He quickly shut me up by kissing my lips and I firmly held his face between my hands, this made him stop kissing me.</p>
      <h2>Y/N: "You know...I wanted to help appa, since the maid is on leave today, he is alone in the kitchen. Now let me go...Joon...</h2><h2>RM: "No..Y/N...Help me and I'll let you go"</h2>
      <h2>Y/N: "I know if I say yes, you'll never stop...Okay I'll help, but only kissing okay? You agree? Later we'll continue what we've started at home."</h2><h2>RM: 'ok'</h2><p>I giggled when I saw him pout, he then procceed to move his head closer to mine.</p>
      <p>Y/N POV</p>
      <h2><p>Before he could kiss me, </p>Y/D/N: "Y/N-aaah!<h2>Y/N: What pa?<h2>Y/D/N: "Can you help with the dishes?"</h2><h2>Y/N: "ummm appa I'm coming" <p>I couldn't stop laughing seeing Joon's despair face</p></h2>
      <h2>Y/N: "I'll go and you just rest here 'Daddy Joon....'</h2><h2>RM: "Yaah! Don't provoke me..."</h2><p>I went to the kitchen and began to help my dad while Joon waited for me to comeback. After a few minutes, I just finished helping in the kitchen and went back into the bedroom.</p>
      <p>I got into the room, RM locked the door and steadily stalked towards me. He then slammed his lips against mine and began to slowly kiss me passionately - while his hand cupped the back of my neck.</p><p>His other hand snaked around my waist, pulling me closer. 
          His tongue danced with mine while I m*oned in between his kiss and his nip at my lower lip. He lifted me up without breaking the kiss and placed me onto the bed. I soon knew his utter motive and I broke the kiss.</p><h2>Y/N: "Joon...Only...Kissing"</h2>
          <p>RM only smirked and hovered over me.</p>
